• Developed the only privacy-oriented web application tool for collecting Instagram account analytics instantly.

• Created a custom JavaScript data extraction algorithm to target, scrape, list, and compare the account data provided by the user.

• Still the only tool (free or paid) allowing Instagram users with private accounts to collect account analytics.

• Conceptualized and executed a secure and robust system that never requires user credentials and collects no user data, setting a new industry standard for data protection and integrity.
